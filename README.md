# Team 2: Object-Oriented Software Engineering

The goal is to create TutorHub.

Team members: Tad Berkery, Ilana Chalom, Matthew Flynn, Katherine Forbes, Nolan Fogarty, Dokyung Yang

It's built using the MERN stack and other technologies detailed in our "Tech Stack" github issue

# Name of the app 

TutorHub

## Installing / Getting started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have Node.js (version 21.6.2) and npm installed on your machine.
- You have created a MongoDB Atlas cluster for use with the app.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/cs421sp24-homework/project-team-02.git```

2. Navigate to the frontend directory: ```cd project-team-02/client```

3. Install frontend dependencies: ```npm install```

4. Navigate to the backend directory: ```cd ../server```

5. Install backend dependencies: ```npm install```

6. Navigate to the root directiory: ```cd ..```

See the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files.

### Configuration

1. Create a .env file in the server directory. Set a variable called ATLAS_URI to the connection string (with user and pwd included) for your cluster:
   ```ATLAS_URI={YOUR_ATLAS_URI}```
   ```ATLAS_URI_TEST={YOUR_ATLAS_URI_FOR_TESTING_CLUSTER}```

3. Create a .env file in the client directory.
   ```NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={YOUR_CLERK_KEY}```
   ```CLERK_SECRET_KEY={YOUR_SECRET_KEY}```
   ```NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL={YOUR_BACKEND_URL}```

4. Use AWS for object storage. Create an AWS account. After establishing your root user, create a new user role called `admin` with full read and write permissions in S3. Create an access key for the admin user role. Encode this info in a file called `aws.env` in the `server` directory in the following format (note that we have omitted our access key ID and secret access key for security reasons):

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_REGION=us-east-2
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=tutorhubprofilepics
```

3. Make sure you have installed the AWS SDK (one way to do this is `npm install aws-sdk`). Note that installing all contains of the `*.json` files above on the server-side should have already sufficiently accomplished this. This will be integral for ensuring the code and S3 are able to communicate and interact.

### Running the app

Run ```npm i``` in root, server, and client directories to install necessary dependencies.
From the root directory (after appropriate installation), start both the frontend and the backend server simultaneously by executing: ```npm run start:all```

### Viewing Deployed App (Server)

An earlier version of our app is deployed at https://project-team-02-git-frontenddepl-b0804a-nolan-fogartys-projects.vercel.app/
The backend (server) is deployed at : https://tutorhub-server.onrender.com
To confirm that it is working, you can visit the url and check if you see "Hello World!" message. 

### Navigating the App

Since we haven't created a landing page, please click the poorly formatted 'Sign-In' button to create an account using your JHU email(must end in @jhu.edu). Once an account is created, add '/profile' to the URL to navigate to your profile page. From here, you should be able to Edit Profile as well as Create Posts using the designated buttons.
