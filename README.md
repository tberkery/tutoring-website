# Tutor Hub

There is no current platform for Hopkins students to easily find tutors for a given course/field, or for tutors to easily advertise their services to students. Moreover, it can be difficult for tutors and students to get in touch with one another and discuss logistics (scheduling, hourly rates, accepted payments, etc.) There is a clear need for a comprehensive, user-friendly platform that facilitates seamless matchmaking between students seeking academic support and tutors offering their expertise within the Hopkins ecosystem.

TutorHub is a fully-fledged tutoring marketplace. It seeks to address these challenges by providing a dedicated platform specifically tailored to the Hopkins community, streamlining the process of finding, selecting, and engaging in personalized tutoring sessions and beyond. By offering intuitive search and filtering options, detailed tutor profiles, direct messaging capabilities and review forums, TutorHub aims to enhance the tutoring experience, foster collaboration, and improve learning outcomes for students while empowering tutors to effectively showcase their skills and connect with students in need. As for the quality of tutors, TutorHub itself will not have a special process of verifying the tutors. The first level of qualification comes from the fact that only Hopkins affiliated people can access this app. We aim to everage shared trust already existing in a defined community and augment it with self-reported talents from tutors. Tutors will showcase their qualification by documenting their relevant experiences, and tutees will freely pick their tutor. There will be repercussions including account ban for the repeatedly reported “scam tutors”. Long-term (beyond this semester), there is potential to expand this to be a product marketed to organizations more broadly, but we will use the Hopkins community for our current goals. Beyond tutoring services, TutorHub further aims to provide a comprehensive and inclusive discussion forum. The idea is to have a centralized hub for the exchange of technical help in an efficient and available manner.

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get the app up & running on a local computer. For example, your advisor might use the instruction here to run the application locally.

```shell
commands here
```

## Developing

Detailed and step-by-step documentation for setting up local development. For example, a new team member will use these instructions to start developing the project further. 

```shell
commands here
```

You should include what is needed (e.g. all of the configurations) to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools (include download links), explaining what database (and version) has been used, etc. If there is any virtual environment, local server, ..., explain here. 

Additionally, describe and show how to run the tests, explain your code style and show how to check it.

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the project after some code changes, state them here. Moreover, give instructions on how to build and release a new version. In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a server, it must be stated here.
